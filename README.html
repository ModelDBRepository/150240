PACKAGE DESCRIPTION
===================

This package is running with the NEURON (v7.x) simulation program
   written by Michael Hines and available on internet at:
   <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/</a>

The package contains programs needed to simulate the thalamocortical
convergence model circuits relative to the paper:

   Béhuret S, Deleuze C, Gomez L, Frégnac Y, Bal T (2013)
   Cortically-Controlled Population Stochastic Facilitation as a
   Plausible Substrate for Guiding Sensory Transfer across the
   Thalamic Gateway.  PLoS Comput Biol 9(12):

A demonstration of the circuit activity will be shown upon startup
along with a simple GUI intended at easily changing the model
parameters. A simulation mode is also provided (to activate this mode,
please refer to the instructions given in Run.hoc).

In the demo mode, activity traces for the cortical and the
thalamocortical cells in an optimal regime (uncorrelated synaptic
noise) will be simulated for 1s. After this period, correlation of the
synaptic noise across the TC cells will be switched from 0% to
99%. Simulated voltage traces will be displayed in a graph.

HOW TO RUN THE DEMO
===================

To compile the program, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and
   working on the machine you are using with appropriately set
   environment variables. To compile the mechanisms given in the mod
   files, just type from the main directory: nrnivmodl

Then, execute the demo by typing:
   nrniv Run.hoc -

The simulation will be started automatically.  Here are zoomed in
displays of 100 ms before and after the time at 1s were the simulation
changes from optimal activity to 99% synaptic noise correlation.
